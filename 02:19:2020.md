# Python yield

### iteration and iterable

iteration is a kind of operation and iterable is an attributes of objects.

most data structures are containers which contain lots of elements of other type.

If we can **pick up elements one by one** from an object, then we call this object iterable.

- **sequential types are iterable** such as list, tuple, string.

### iterator

iterator is **an object**.

iterator abstract a data stream.

make use of next() function to pick up next element sequentially. when the iterator become empty, the call to next will throw exceptions.

### iterator protocol

when python handle for loop, firstly it calls build-in function `iter(something)`. In fact, it calls `something.__iter__()` which returns corresponding iterator. Then for loop will call build-in function `next()` working on iterator to pick up next element

# generator function and generator

if a function include `yield` , It's a generator function and when we call it, it will return a generator.

```python
# this function return a 'int'
# so type(func()) will be <class 'int'>
def func():
	return 1
```

#### yield 

```python
def square():
    for x in range(4):
        yield x ** 2
square_gen = square()
for x in square_gen:
    print(x)
```



```python
genitor = square_gen.__iter__()
while True:
    x = geniter.next() # Python 3 æ˜¯ __next__()
    print(x)
```

these two code above are equal.

Square_gen is an iterator. when it comes to` x = geniter.next()` , we will start from where we were before the pause to the next `yeild` and return the expression behind this `yeild`. then pause again.

#### iterator methods

- next()
- send(value)
- Close

#### easy way to understand

```python
def func():
  result = list()
  result.append(expr) # yield expr
  return result
```



- it's like a bridge btween y and x below. Kind of like the channel in Golang

```python
def func():
    x = 1
    while True:
        y = yield x
        x += y
geniter.next()  # 1
# we cant call next() here cause the function need to be sended a value to assign to variable y or y == None
geniter.send(3) # 4
geniter.send(10)# 14
```
